# RSS-News-Feeder
Simple client-side application that allows users to view RSS news feeds from a variety of sources. The list of available sources is dynamic, determined by a web server. The user selects a source, then sees all of the news items that originate from the selected source.

Various news feeds provide 'news-items' objects with different structures. A mapping object, called 'FeedSchema', is used to pull data from sources with varying structure and make the data appear uniform to the client.
